with same parameter with skel: bad matches, distorted image

reduced edge thresh and patch size to 120 from 150: appropriate overlap, acceptable (even good) ratio of good and bad matches

with et and ps at 100, extremely distorted homography, high number of bad matches

Iterative two-sided offset check has significantly improved the matching result, although not much improvement was seen in the homography output
Possible reason for homography performance stagnation: RANSAC in cv2.findHomography() does a decent job at eliminating outliers
